\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
Data mining has become an important strategic factor within the enterprise environment as it allows non-trivial information to be identified in order to leverage business or even promote product and service innovations. In this context, data classification is one of the most important and recurring topics encountered in data mining and in this way the following work aims to propose a multiobjective algorithm based on PSO for data classification through rule extraction. In this approach, each particle (candidate solution) represents a classification rule that is converted into a logical predicate for subsequent use in a selection operation in the SQL language for performance evaluation of the algorithm. In experiments carried out, the proposed approach proved to be competitive, with promising results when compared to other classical classification methods recognized in the literature and to present satisfactory results especially in unbalanced datasets.
